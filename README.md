# SmartClinic

**SmartClinic** is a web-based medication tracking system developed by **Ilhan Idriss** during his 2023 internship as a web developer. The project was originally submitted as his **Final Year Project (FYP)** at **UiTM Johor**.

---

## 🔧 How Was SmartClinic Built?

Initially, SmartClinic was developed using the standard web development stack:

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- **Backend**: PHP  
- **Purpose**: To help clinic doctors and staff track medicine availability and records

The initial version was submitted as a complete FYP to the university supervisor.

## 💡 Evolution and Idea Expansion

After completing and submitting the first version, Idriss realized that SmartClinic had the potential to become more than a simple medicine inventory tool. With the rise of **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** and **Machine Learning (ML)**, he envisioned SmartClinic as a smart assistant for everyday users — not just for clinic staff.

> _“It could be integrated into everyone’s daily life, making medication tracking smarter and more accessible.”_

## 🔁 Rebuilding SmartClinic (Late 2024)

In late 2024, Idriss began **rebuilding SmartClinic from scratch** using:

- **Framework**: Django (Python)
- **Concepts**:
  - Machine Learning (for future features like prescription prediction, smart reminders)
  - Modern UI/UX principles
  - Scalable architecture for long-term use

The goal:  
To transform SmartClinic into a **personalized, intelligent medication assistant** that supports both clinical environments and individual users.
